## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This analysis uses the data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" found here:  

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The run_analysis.R script summarizes that data, providing an average value for the mean and standard deviation measures of each of the original variables by activity and subject.

The full list and description of the variables used in this analysis can be found in CodeBook.md.

The run_analysis.R script outputs a csv file called "tidydf.csv" containing the tidy data set generated by the analysis.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- A 66-feature vector with mean and standard deviation of time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- The average of each variable

This project includes the following files:
=========================================

Readme.md:  This file.
CodeBook.md:  A list of all features and information about those features  
              as well as the activities and subjects.
run_analysis.R: Script that summarizes the data by calculating an 
                average value for each feature by subject and activity.
tidydf.csv:  An example of the output generated by run_analysis.R
